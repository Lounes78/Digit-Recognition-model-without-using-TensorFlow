# Simple 2-Layer Neural Network for Digit Recognition

This repository contains a basic implementation of a 2-layer neural network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The neural network is coded entirely using fundamental Linear Algebra concepts and leverages Gradient Descent formulas.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a minimalistic neural network implementation for recognizing handwritten digits. It serves as an educational example for those interested in understanding the core concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

## Features

- 2-layer neural network architecture.
- Digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
- Basic Linear Algebra operations for forward and backward propagation.
- Gradient Descent optimization for model training.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Pandas (for data preprocessing)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
